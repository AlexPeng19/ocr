# MLP character recognition

Trains a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to perform optical character recognition (OCR). The training set is automatically generated using a modified version of the captcha-generator [node-captcha](http://npmjs.com/package/node-captcha).

The script moves each character to the center of the 400-bit (20x20) network input using a center of mass calculation to maximize success rate.

Below are examples of input images from training sets generated for recognition of numbers ```0-9``` and letters ```a-z``` respectively.

## Performance

Currently, the best performing MLP generated by this script has a success rate of ```82%``` on numbers ```0-9``` and is located in ```examples/0-9/network.js```. Below are specs for the network (copied from log output).

```
neural network specs:
  layers:
    input: 400 neurons.
    hidden: 40 neurons.
    output: 8 neurons.
  learning rate: 0.1
  training set: 2000 images containing 40000 distorted characters.
```

## Usage

Clone this repository and make sure the ```input``` folder exists before running

```bash
$ npm install
$ node main.js
```
